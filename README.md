Final Assignment for Developing Data Products course.

If you're here, that means that you're also taking the Developing Data Products course. Hello! Aren't you glad we're almost finished? Also, does anyone actually read the README?

For the final project, we need to write a [Shiny app](https://clearwriter.shinyapps.io/CourseraDDP/), deploy it to Shinyapps.io, and set it loose for the world to play with. Done.

Next, we need to write pitch slides and post them to either Github or Rpubs. 

Why did I choose this particular dataset? You can read all about it in ABOUT.md, but it's basically because I'm a LEGO geek and I'm reliving my childhood through this project.
