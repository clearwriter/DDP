I'm a LEGO geek, so much so that I saved all of my childhood bricks, from the brightly colored 2x4s of the 1970s to my beloved space set from the 1980s. When I ran a Google search for interesting datasets and discovered that there was a database of all Lego sets since 1950, I couldn't resist. 

The raw data for this project can be found on Rebrickable.com. It contains all of the basic information: set ID, year of release, number of pieces and of course, the set name.
