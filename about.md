I'm a LEGO geek, so much so that I saved all of my childhood bricks, from the brightly colored 2x4s of the 1970s to my beloved space set from the 1980s. When I ran a Google search for interesting datasets and discovered that there was a database of all Lego sets since 1950, I couldn't resist. 

Also, this helped me to figure out that my favorite LEGO space set was actually a mix of [6929-1, the Star Fleet Voyager](http://brickset.com/sets/6929-1), and [920-2, the Alpha-1 Rocket Base](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/920_Launch_Pad). I'm now inspired to download the instructions to see if I still have enough of the original pieces to rebuild these Classic Space sets that played such a large role in my childhood.  

The raw data for this project can be found on Rebrickable.com. It contains all of the basic information: set ID, year of release, number of pieces and of course, the set name. 

Want to run the app from Github? It's easy. 
```
runGitHub( "DDP", "clearwriter") 
```

You can also run the app directly from [Shiny apps](https://clearwriter.shinyapps.io/CourseraDDP/).
